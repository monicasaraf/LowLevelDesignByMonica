# Adapter Design Pattern

- It acts like an intermediary that allows laptop to work with a device that it does not support directly.
- It changes one form to another form.

Purpose -

- They try to convert one format to other to allow working with a device not directly supported.
- Adapter DP allows a class to work with another class that is not directly supported.
- Always consider using adapter dp when you have to work with 3rd party APIs
