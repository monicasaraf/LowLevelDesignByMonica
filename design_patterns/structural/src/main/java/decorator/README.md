# Decorator Design Pattern

- **Attaches additional responsibilities** to an object **dynamically**.
- Provides an alternative for sub-classing i.e. extending functionality.
- It changes one form to another form.
- Inheritance is not for code reuse or sharing behavior, in-fact it is composition that allows you to share behavior.

Purpose -

- They try to convert one format to other to allow working with a device not directly supported.
- Adapter DP allows a class to work with another class that is not directly supported.
- Always consider using adapter dp when you have to work with 3rd party APIs
