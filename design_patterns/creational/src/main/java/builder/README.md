Builder design pattern allows you to create an object when we have the below requirements -

1. When we have classes with a lot of attributes.

1. Pron to errors (as we might put some wrong value for wrong argument)

## Problems With Multiple Constructors

1. Too many overloaded constructors
2. Sometimes it might not be even possible to have the overloaded constructors
