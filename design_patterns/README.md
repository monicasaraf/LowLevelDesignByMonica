# Classification of patterns

1. Creational patterns
2. Structural patterns
3. Behavioral patterns

- Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures
  flexible and efficient.
- Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
